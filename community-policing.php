		<h2>Community Policing</h2>
		<div class="">Policies have wide acceptance among editors and describe standards that all users should normally follow. All policy pages are in Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines and Category:Wikipedia policies. For summaries of key policies, see also List of policies.

Guidelines are sets of best practices that are supported by consensus. Editors should attempt to follow guidelines, though they are best treated with common sense, and occasional exceptions may apply. Guideline pages can be found in Wikipedia:List of policies and guidelines and Category:Wikipedia guidelines. For summaries of key guidelines, see also List of guidelines.

Essays are the opinion or advice of an editor or group of editors for which widespread consensus has not been established. They do not speak for the entire community and may be created and written without approval. Essays that the author does not want others to edit, or that contradict widespread consensus, belong in the user namespace. (For more information, see Wikipedia:Essays.)

Other administration pages in the Wikipedia: namespace include:

Process pages, which facilitate application of the policies and guidelines (e.g. Wikipedia:Articles for deletion),
WikiProject pages, including essays they have written to give advice to other editors about their areas of interest,
How-to or help pages (also found in the Help namespace), which provide mainly technical information,
Information pages, which generally provide factual information,
Supplements to guidelines and policies, which explain advice in greater detail,
Community discussion pages and noticeboards for communication between editors, and
Historical pages, which are outdated.</div>
